These are custom mug designs were created in paint 3D. This folder only contains the PNG files that show the mugs from different angles. The graphics stamps come from non-copyrighted jpegs. The taglines/wordplays are original and the logo is the copyrighted logo of Dr C Ross Crapo and Associates. 

The smiley face mug is color-changing and starts as the black mug. When filled with hot water it changes to the white mug. The "Royalty" mug PNG contains an alternate front design.
