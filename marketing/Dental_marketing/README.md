# Explanation
These are custom mug designs that were created in paint 3D. This folder only contains the PNG files that show the mugs from different angles. The graphics stamps come from non-copyrighted jpegs. The taglines/wordplays are original and the logo is the copyrighted logo of Dr C Ross Crapo and Associates. 

The smiley face mug is color-changing and starts as the black mug. When filled with hot water it changes to the white mug. The "Royalty" mug PNG contains an alternate front design.
